The issue with Gemini image generation was that it was **generating inaccurate or offensive images of people**, particularly when it came to generating images of specific ethnicities or groups in specific cultural or historical contexts. This was due to two main factors:

1. **Over-tuning for diversity:**  The model was designed to generate a range of images of people to represent diversity. However, this tuning failed to account for specific cases where a range of images was not appropriate, such as depicting historical figures or specific ethnicities in their correct context.
2. **Over-conservatism:**  Over time, the model became overly cautious and started refusing to generate images for certain prompts, wrongly interpreting even harmless prompts as sensitive.

These two factors led to the model generating images that were either inaccurate, offensive, or simply refusing to create images of certain groups of people.

**As a result, Google temporarily paused Gemini's image generation of people and are working on improving the model's accuracy and reliability before re-enabling the feature.** They are doing this by:

* **Testing extensively:** They are conducting extensive testing to ensure the model generates accurate and unbiased images.
* **Addressing over-conservatism:** They are working to address the over-conservatism issue so the model can respond to a wider range of prompts without misinterpreting them as sensitive.
